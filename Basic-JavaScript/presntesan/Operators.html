    <!-- 1. Introduction to Operators

    In JavaScript, operators are special symbols that are used to perform operations on values or variables.
    They help the program calculate, compare, and make decisions.

    Example:

    let sum = 10 + 5;


    Here, + is the operator and 10 and 5 are operands.




    2. Why Operators Are Important

    Operators are important because:

    1)They help perform mathematical calculations

    2)They allow decision making in programs

    3)They control the flow of execution

    4)They make programs dynamic and interactive

    Without operators, programs cannot process data properly



    3. Types of Operators in JavaScript

    JavaScript mainly has the following types of operators:

    1)Arithmetic Operators

    2)Assignment Operators

    3)Comparison Operators

    4)Logical Operators

    5)Unary Operators

    6)Ternary Operator

    7)String Operators

    8)Type Operators


    Each type is used for a specific purpose.


    (1). Arithmetic Operators (Theory)

    Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.

    They work with numbers and return a numeric result.

    Examples:

    + → Addition

    - → Subtraction

    * → Multiplication

    / → Division

    % → Modulus (remainder)

    These operators are commonly used in calculations like billing systems, calculators, and score calculations.



    (2) Assignment Operators (Theory)

    Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

    They can also update the existing value of a variable.

    Examples:

    = Assign

    += Add and assign

    -= Subtract and assign

    *= Multiply and assign

    /= Divide and assign

    %= Modulus and assign

    **= Exponent and assign

    They help reduce code length and improve readability.


    (3) Comparison Operators (Theory)

    Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false).

    They are commonly used in:

    Conditions

    Loops

    Decision-making statements

    Examples:

    == Equal (value only)

    === Strict Equal (value & type)

    != Not equal (value only)

    !== Strict not equal

    > Greater than

    < Less than>= Greater or equal

    <= Less or equal 
    
    
    (4) Logical Operators (Theory) 
    Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions.

    Types: 
    
    && (AND): All conditions must be true 

    || (OR): Any one condition must be true 
    
    ! (NOT): Reverses the
    
    result They are mainly used in if-else statements and loops.

    (5) Unary Operators (Theory) 

    Unary operators work with only one operand. 

    Common unary operators: 

    ++ increment 

    -- decrement 

    (6) Ternary Operator (Theory)

    The ternary operator is a short form of if-else statement. 

    Syntax: condition ? expression1 : expression2 It

    makes the code shorter and easier to read. 
    
    (7)String Operators 
    
    Operator   Description       Example 

    +          Concatenation     "Hello" + " World" → "Hello World"

    +=         Append            let str="Hi" ; str +="!" → "Hi!" 

    (8)Type Operators
    
    typeof → returns type of operand. 
    
    instanceof → checks object type. 
    
    
    Conclusion : 
    Operators are one of the most important parts of JavaScript. 

    They help in:
     (1)Performing calculations 
     (2)Making decisions 
     (3)Controlling program flow 
     (4)Understanding operators is essential to become a good JavaScript developer.
